I had my Business law exam today as a part of my MBA at IIM Kozhikode and it went well. A significant part of the course deals with Contract law, the Companies Act 2013 and the various rules and regulations that govern companies in India.

I remembered my former boss, [Mr UK Bhattacharya](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/videos/guest-address-ujjwal-kanti-bhattacharya-senior-advisor-ntpc-and-former-director-ntpc-limited/117448956), former Director of NTPC who mabe me read the Companies Act in and out. He used to say that the Companies Act is the Bible for a company and every employee should read it at least once. Even though I didnot understand him then, I agree with him completely now - especially after going through the course and running a company myself.

I run [Zeorwatt](), an energy startup with my friends and as an entrepreneur, I have to deal with various aspects of the Companies Act on a daily basis. It coulld be something as simple as filing the annual return or something as complex as a share transfer or a rights issue. I have to deal with the Companies Act on a daily basis and it is important to understand the law and how it applies to my company. Interactions with my chartered accountant and the company secretary clears a lot of my doubts, but I still need to understand the law myself. You cannot rely on others all the time. There could be a time where you need to make a decision quickly and you cannot wait for your CA or CS to respond. Every time I do this, I am reminded of Mr Bhattacharya's words.

Reading the Companies Act is not just about understanding the law, but also about understanding how companies operate in India. It gives you a framework to work within and helps you make informed decisions. It also helps you understand your rights and responsibilities as a director or shareholder of a company. 

I would recommend every entrepreneur - especially a startup founder -  to read the Companies Act. It is a long read, but it is worth it.
