So, you decided to have your own company. You have to take a few important decisions:
- Should I register my company as a private company of an LLP?
- Will a One Person Comapny OPC work?
- How much should be the authorised capital?
- How much is the pais up capital?

Answering these questions can be overwhelming and you need someone with experience to guide you. One option is to ask others who has done this before. Alternately, you could find a good Chartered Accountant to answer these questions for you. Finding a CA for your company is very much like a marriage - you are going to be together for a very long time. So choose wisely. 

Pick a CA who has worked with starups before. They should also have tieups with Company Secretaries. There is a log of going back and forth between CA & CS - This could be during compnay registrastion, share transfers, annual filings etc. If a single firm is hanlding both, you can focus more  on things that matters - building your company
