Should you strart a company on day 1? Answer is No. 

You are going to be validating your idea, and you need to be flexible. You need to be able to pivot, and you need to be able to change your mind. You need to be able to iterate on your idea, and you need to be able to test it out in the real world. All of this is going to take time and you may even pivot your idea completely. You may even find that your idea is not a good one, and you need to start over. This is all part of the process of building a startup, and it is something that you need to be prepared for.

You can hold the idea of registering the company an doing a lot of paperwork till you are in a comfortable position to do so. Even when you reach there, there are a few options - a one person company, a partnership, or an limited liability partnership (LLP) or a private limited company - each with its own benefits and issues.

If you are a solo founder, you can start with a one person company. This is the simplest and most straightforward option, and it allows you to get started quickly. However, it does have some limitations, such as the fact that you will be personally liable for any debts or obligations of the company.
If you are planning to bring on co-founders or partners, you may want to consider a partnership or an LLP. These options allow you to share the risks and rewards of the business with your partners, and they also provide some level of liability protection. However, they can be more complex to set up and manage, and they may require more paperwork and legal fees.

Finally, if you are planning to raise money from investors or venture capitalists, you will likely need to set up a private limited company. This option provides the most liability protection and is the most common structure for startups seeking investment. However, it can be more expensive and time-consuming to set up, and it may require more ongoing compliance and reporting.

You can always start with a one person company or a partnership, and then convert to a private limited company later on if you decide to raise money or bring on partners. This can be a good way to get started quickly and test your idea without committing to a more complex structure right away.

| Type of company         | Requirements | benefits | Issues                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------- |

| LLP                     | a            | a        | a                                |
| Private limited company | a            | a        | Expensive, Complinace, paperwork |


In the meantime, you could do some simple steps like purchasing the domain name, and setting up a simple website. You can also start building a community around your idea, and start talking to potential customers. This is all part of the process of validating your idea, and it is something that you need to be doing before you start a company
